Python3 version of Andrej Karpathy's Neural Networks blog http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/

I've initially started out to translate just the Javascript code on the blog to Python3. But I realized later that it would be better to write the Jupyter Notebook version of the blog as a reference because, just the code snippets without any explanation weren't making much sense.

**Disclaimer:** I don't claim the contents of the Notebook to be a work of my own, it's all the hardwork of Andrej Karpathy. I'm just trying to help people not familiar in Javascript/much familiar in Python to understand the blog better, by able to execute the implementations.
